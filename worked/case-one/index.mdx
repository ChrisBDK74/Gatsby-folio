Case Study: Social Good Foundation

Purpose of this case study:
To identify areas of a corporate website where accurate and accessible information 
has a high priority for the user and solve current issues.

Some of the problems I tried to identify and solve are:

* UX: Overall user experience of the English version of the website.
* Visual design and opportunities for improvement.
* Information architecture and site structure.
