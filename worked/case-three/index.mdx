Case Study 3: Social Good
Purpose of this case study:
To identify areas of a private corporate website where areas of improvement and opportunities
can be found which benefits both the users and the company.

Social Good is a "social-crypto" company, meaning that they work to give back to the users
of their services. They do this by rewarding shopping online with the social good crypto currency. 

Some of the problems I tried to identify and solve are:
* UX: Overall user experience of the English version of the website.
* User Interface issues and the opportunities for improvement.
* Information architecture and site structure.
