Case Study 3: Social Good Foundation

Purpose of this case study:
To identify areas of a private company website where accurate and accessible information 
has a high priority to the user.

Some of the problems I tried to identify and solve are:
* UX: Overall user experience of the English version of the website.
* Visual design and opportunities for improvement.
* Information architecture and site structure.
